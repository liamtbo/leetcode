1. Input/Output Functions (from <stdio.h>)

    printf(): Outputs formatted text to the console.
    scanf(): Reads formatted input from the console.
    gets(), puts(): Reads a string from input and writes a string to output (though gets() is unsafe and not recommended).
    fgets(), fputs(): Safer versions of gets() and puts() for file handling or input/output.

2. String Functions (from <string.h>)

    strlen(): Returns the length of a string.
    strcpy(), strncpy(): Copies a string from one location to another.
    strcat(), strncat(): Concatenates (appends) one string to another.
    strcmp(), strncmp(): Compares two strings (with or without a limit on length).
    strstr(): Finds the first occurrence of a substring in a string.
    strchr(): Finds the first occurrence of a character in a string.
    strtok(): Splits a string into tokens based on a delimiter.

3. Memory Management Functions (from <stdlib.h>)

    malloc(): Allocates a block of memory on the heap.
    calloc(): Allocates memory for an array and initializes all elements to zero.
    realloc(): Reallocates memory to change the size of a previously allocated block.
    free(): Frees a previously allocated block of memory.

4. Mathematical Functions (from <math.h>)

    pow(): Computes the power of a number.
    sqrt(): Computes the square root of a number.
    abs(): Returns the absolute value of an integer.
    ceil(), floor(): Rounds a floating-point number up or down to the nearest integer.
    sin(), cos(), tan(): Trigonometric functions for sine, cosine, and tangent.
    log(), log10(): Computes the natural or base-10 logarithm of a number.

5. Character Functions (from <ctype.h>)

    isalpha(): Checks if a character is an alphabetic letter.
    isdigit(): Checks if a character is a digit.
    isalnum(): Checks if a character is alphanumeric.
    isspace(): Checks if a character is a whitespace character.
    toupper(), tolower(): Converts a character to uppercase or lowercase.

6. Standard Library Functions (from <stdlib.h>)

    atoi(), atof(), atol(): Converts a string to an integer, float, or long.
    rand(), srand(): Generates pseudo-random numbers.
    exit(): Exits the program and returns a status code to the operating system.
    system(): Executes a system command.

7. File Handling Functions (from <stdio.h>)

    fopen(), fclose(): Opens or closes a file.
    fread(), fwrite(): Reads from or writes to a file.
    fscanf(), fprintf(): Formatted input/output for files.
    fgetc(), fputc(): Reads or writes a character from/to a file.
    feof(): Checks for the end of a file.
    fseek(), ftell(): Moves the file pointer to a specific location and returns its position.

8. Memory Functions (from <string.h>)

    memcpy(): Copies memory from one location to another.
    memset(): Fills a block of memory with a specific value.
    memmove(): Moves memory from one location to another, safely handling overlapping regions.

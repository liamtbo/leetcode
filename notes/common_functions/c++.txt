1. Input/Output Functions

    std::cout: Used to output data to the standard output (console).
    std::cin: Used to read input from the standard input (keyboard).
    std::getline: Reads a full line of input, including spaces, into a string variable.

2. String Functions (from <string>)

    length(): Returns the number of characters in the string.
    substr(): Extracts a substring from the string based on specified starting position and length.
    find(): Searches for a substring within the string and returns its position if found.
    append(): Adds characters to the end of the string.
    c_str(): Returns a C-style string (null-terminated character array) representation of the string.

3. Mathematical Functions (from <cmath>)

    std::abs(): Returns the absolute value of a number.
    std::sqrt(): Computes the square root of a number.
    std::pow(): Raises a number to the power of another number.
    std::sin(): Computes the sine of an angle (in radians).
    std::cos(): Computes the cosine of an angle (in radians).
    std::tan(): Computes the tangent of an angle (in radians).

4. Container Functions (from <vector>, <list>, etc.)
    std::vector<dtype>: dynamic memory
    queue<dtype>
    pair<dtype,dtype>    

    push_back(): Adds an element to the end of a container (like a vector).
    pop_back(): pops last element in container
    size(): Returns the number of elements in the container.
    at(): Accesses an element at a specific index with bounds checking.
    begin(): Returns an iterator pointing to the first element of the container.
    end(): Returns an iterator pointing to one past the last element of the container.

5. Algorithm Functions (from <algorithm>)

    std::sort(): Sorts a range of elements in ascending order.
    std::find(): Searches for a specific element in a range and returns an iterator to it if found.
    std::max(): Returns the largest of two values.
    std::min(): Returns the smallest of two values.

6. Memory Management Functions

    new: Allocates memory for an object or array and returns a pointer to it.
    delete: Deallocates memory that was previously allocated with new.



classes
    #include <iostream>
    class Doggo {
        std::string name;
        int age;

        public:
            Doggo(std::string n, int a) {
                this->name = n;
                this->age = a;
            }
            void dogtag() {
                std::cout << name << ": " << age << std::endl;
            }
    };
    int main() {
        Doggo mydog("cynder", 12);
        mydog.dogtag();
    }
    
arrays
    1d
        int* array = new int[size];  // Allocate memory for an array of integers
    2d
        int** matrix = new int*[rows];      // Allocate memory for an array of row pointers
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            matrix[i] = new int[columns];   // Allocate memory for each row
        }
    2d vector
        std::vector<std::vector<dtype>> varname;
